# Fogo

Fogo is an application that implements a smart contract on both the Ethereum and Polygon networks. This smart contract facilitates the decentralized exchange of digital assets, providing a secure and transparent platform for users to trade tokens.

## Usage

### Running Locally

To run the Fogo smart contract locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory: `/contracts`

3. Open the most recent project file in your preferred development environment or text editor.

4. Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler, such as Remix, Truffle, or Brownie.

5. Deploy the compiled smart contract to a local Ethereum network, such as Ganache, for testing and development purposes.

6. Interact with the deployed smart contract using a tool like Remix, a local web interface, or a command-line interface.

### Using Remix

Alternatively, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE and compiler, to interact with the Fogo smart contract.

1. Open the [Remix website](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.

2. Create a new file for the smart contract code, or copy and paste the code from this repository.

3. Compile the smart contract using the Remix compiler.

4. Deploy the compiled smart contract to an Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., Remix's built-in JavaScript VM, a local Ganache instance, or a testnet).

5. Interact with the deployed smart contract through Remix's user interface to test its functionality.
